### The Concept.

My final project on WDI using a Ruby of Rails backend and AngularJS front-end framework. Remote Composer is an open source music composition platform, for composers and artists who want to collaborate and develop musical ideas together. We decided to create a platform for composers to upload their unfinished ideas, with the intention of other composers being able to contribute to that 'idea' and result in a beautiful and collaborative composition.

### Tech used:

<li>Ruby on Rails</li>

<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>SCSS/SASS</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>FileStack</li>
</ul>
