I'm currently working within the performing arts industry as a web developer, whilst active as a freelance jazz musician - performing, teaching and continuing study. Though currently based in London, I'm originally from Derbyshire and lived in Hong Kong for a few years. I studied Music at university, and recently completed the 3 month immersive web development course with General Assembly, having realised I'm passionate about creating and utilising technology to improve others' everyday lives.
