### Overview

#### MEAN STACK WEB APP

A team project, we built a RESTful app inspired by our experience so far in the tech world. CodeFund is a space to ask technical questions to fellow developers, with questioners donating to the charity chosen by the owner of the best answer. My teammates and I wanted to explore using tech for good; how to contribute to charity alongside providing a service.
