My final project on WDI using a Ruby of Rails backend and AngularJS front-end framework. Remote Composer is an open source music composition platform, for composers and artists who want to collaborate and develop musical ideas together. We decided to create a platform for composers to upload their unfinished ideas, with the intention of other composers being able to contribute to that ‘idea’ and result in a beautiful and collaborative composition.
