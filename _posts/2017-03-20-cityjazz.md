### The Concept

An authenticated app using the Google Maps and Yelp APIâ€™s alongside a city mapper integration. The app allows users to locate jazz venues in London, find out more information and navigate to them. Written in javaScript and jQuery, this was my first experience working with an external API.

### Tech used
